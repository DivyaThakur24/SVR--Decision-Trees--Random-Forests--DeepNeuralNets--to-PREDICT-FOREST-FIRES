##  This notebook is an implementation of the work shown in the paper :

***This repo is an implementation of the research paper "A Data Mining Approach to Predict Forest Fires using Meteorological Data." by P. Cortez and A. Morais. http://www.dsi.uminho.pt/~pcortez/fires.pdf***


***Using Regression to predict Forest Fires*** 
This is a regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data. 
Collected from [UCI ML repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). Details can be found -  (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires).

***A comparision of four methods has been done ::***

* ***Support Vector Regression***
* ***Decision Trees***
* ***Random Forest***
* ***Deepnets(Keras with tensorflow backend)***
